# BonnieLang

BonnieLang is an esoteric programming language.
It is an interpreted language where the content of the input script are translated as input in a game where bonnie lives on a grid.
Bonnie can move on this grid, moving to square that can be activated to do something (add number to stack, do math, call function).
